# Magic

There are a lot of words which can be used to describe a spell.
These words are then interpreted by the computer, who creates an effect.

A working spell has these components:

Target
Effect
Intensity
Conditions
Probability

If the caster doesn't specify all criteria, the computer decides what exactly happens and how the rest is computed.
Every spell also costs Mana Points, which are calculated out of the effect of the resulting spell.
