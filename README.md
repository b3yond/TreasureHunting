# Treasure Hunting

Treasure Hunting is supposed to be a small game.
Originally it was played in school by a few bored teenagers, with pen and paper - but we want to bring it on screen!
This is actually the 4th edition of Treasure Hunting, but the first to be realized digitally.

# About

In the world of Treasure Hunting, vampires, werewolves, angels, and several other supernatural entities are coexisting peacefully with the humans. Well, not that peaceful actually - usually they are used by corporations and other militant groups as effective mercenaries. You are playing one of these soldiers, and are deciding their fate in a world full of corporate interests, racist hostilities and violence.

# Contents

there have been several approaches in this project. The python files contain:

1. TreasureHunting.py: This was a first approach. it used a command line to define some of the first game choices, but didn't go much further.
2. battlefield1_0_7.py: This tried to realize a battlefield with tkinter and the rest with the command line, but failed. but there are several working things, e.g. the item and character system. mainly had an error with the walk function.
3. multiwindow.py: also tried to do this with tkinter, but with multiple windows. also failed, because I didn't understand tkinter. tkinter ist just not the way you should do something like this.

There is also some game data:

1. images: these are gifs, used in the final game.
2. music: the game music - currently it is one self written midi track.
3. code: contains old code versions, may be useful for using old working code.
4. notes: these are text files which explain the game and define some of its core mechanics and game data.

# Future Approaches

We should realize this project with the OGRE engine, it also works for python2. It has implemented the management of items and a lot of that stuff, and is generally awesome. need to read into it first, though. We will propably decide how to do this on march 19, 2016.
